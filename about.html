            <p class="q1">What are Mario Games?</p>
            <p class="a1">Mario games are games featuring or inspired by Mario, the iconic Italian plumber and 
            treasured videogame character. You can play Mario in fighting situations, running games,
            and the classic platform format from which Mario first emerged. There’s also plenty of 
            fun games like Mario to play.<br> Ario is a man who’s been with us since the dawn of modern 
            video gaming. Even now, the simplicity of a 2D platformer is as popular as ever. You can enjoy
            Super Mario Run for the classic Mario experience, or check out Unfair Mario if you want to play
            the game with a cruel twist.</p>
